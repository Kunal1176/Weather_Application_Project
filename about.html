      <p>
        Weather is the state of the atmosphere, including temperature,
        atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and cloud cover. It
        differs from climate, which is all weather conditions for a particular
        location averaged over about 30 years. Weather is influenced by
        latitude, altitude, and local and regional geography. It impacts the way
        people dress each day and the types of structures built. Weather is
        driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between
        one place and another. These differences can occur due to the Sun's
        angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude.</p>

        <h1> What is an API Key? </h1>
      <p>  Application Programming Interface is referred to as API. The term “application” in the context of APIs refers to any software with a specific purpose. A contract of service between two apps can be compared to an interface. This agreement specifies the requests and responses that the two computer will use to communicate. Developers can find instructions in their API documentation on how to format those requests and responses.</p>
